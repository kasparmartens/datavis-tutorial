Read in the data sets

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df_exprs <- readRDS("data/TCGA_exprs.rds")
head(df_exprs)

df_clinical <- readRDS("data/TCGA_clinical.rds")
head(df_clinical)

df_pca <- readRDS("data/TCGA_pca.rds")
head(df_pca)
```

Convert the expression data into tidy format

```{r}
# your code
```

Join the three different data sets, using the sample IDs for merging. This will be useful for further analysis. 

```{r}
# your code
```

Filter out 10 most variable genes. What would be an informative way to visualise these?

```{r}
# your code
```

Perhaps boxplots for every PAM50 subtype?

```{r}
# your code
```

Or perhaps plot the expression of these genes against PC1?

```{r}
# your code
```
