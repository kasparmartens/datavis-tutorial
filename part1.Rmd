```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df <- readRDS("data/TCGA_processed.rds")

df
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = pc1, y = pc2, col = ER_status)) +
  geom_point()
```

Design an informative (and nice) visualisation for showing how well PC1 distinguishes between PAM50 subtypes. 

```{r}
# your code
```


Dplyr exercise. 

Order the PAM50 subtypes by the number of observations in each subtype. 

```{r}
# your code
```


Calculate the mean PC1 and PC2 value for every PAM50 subtype. Can you add this to the PC1-PC2 scatterplot?

```{r}
# your code
```
