# Tidyverse

A popular collection of R packages for data import, manipulation, exploration and visualization.


* Unified and consistent design and API (unlike base R)
* Intuitive underlying philosophy
* Easy-to-learn
* Easy to get help: large community on stackoverflow, twitter #rstats etc

# Are visualisations useful?

class: middle

Consider the following data (N=20, p=2)

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(0)
t <- sort(runif(20, 0, 2*pi))
x <- 2*cos(t)
y <- 2*sin(t)
df <- data.frame(x, y)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(round(df[1:10, ], 3), format = 'html')
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(round(df[11:20, ], 3), format = 'html')
```

# How can we visualise the distribution of a continuous variable, compared across two (or more) groups?

Try to think of as many different approaches as you can. What are the pros and cons of each?

# What if there are more than two or three variables?

That is, how to visualise high-dimensional data?

--

Options include:

* visualise a subset of variables, 

    * randomly selected
    
    * selection based on summary statistics

* compute summary statistics and visualise those instead

* apply a dimensionality reduction method such as PCA

### Can we trust the patterns that we see?

Subgroup structure (or other variables) may help to explain the patterns

Based on the Grammar of Graphics (book by Leland Wilkinson, 1999/2005) -- idea that every graph can be built from the same components. Results in a very flexible framework for plotting.
